/*
    Do.....While loop 

    The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

    Syntax : 
            // Initialization
            do{
                //statement
                // increment/Decrement
            }while (condition);

    statement is always executed once before the condition is checked.

    If condition is true, the statement executes again. At the end of every execution, the condition is checked. When the condition is false, execution stops, and control passes to the statement following do...while.
